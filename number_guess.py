"""Wanna play a game? In this project, we'll build a program that rolls a pair of dice and asks the user to guess a number. Based on the user's guess, the program should determine a winner. If the user's guess is greater than the total value of the dice roll, they win! Otherwise, the computer wins.

The program should do the following:

Randomly roll a pair of dice
Add the values of the roll
Ask the user to guess a number
Compare the user's guess to the total value
Decide a winner (the user or the program)
Inform the user who the winner is"""
